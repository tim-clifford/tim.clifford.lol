Other things about me!

## Contact

I'm always happy to hear people's ideas and opinions about my stuff. Also just
if you want to send me something cool! No ads though of course.

**Matrix**: @tim:clifford.lol

**Email**: tim(@)clifford.lol (I get a lot of spam, it might take me a while to
reply). [If you send something signed and encrypted I'll reply
quicker!](https://tim.clifford.lol/tim_clifford.asc).

**Anything proprietary**: Don't even think about it

## SRCF

I'm a sysadmin for the Student Run Computing Facility, a volunteer-run student
society that provides free, useful and flexible computing and network services
for University of Cambridge staff and students. See more
[here](https://www.srcf.net)

## Me in other places

Check out my Gemini site! If you don't know what Gemini is, it's a "smolnet"
alternative to the http/html ecosystem - leaner, meaner, and more wholesome.
You'll need a special browser to view it, then find me at
gemini://tim.clifford.lol/ :)

You can also find me on SourceHut [here](https://git.sr.ht/~tim-clifford), where my
active projects are hosted, or on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/tim-clifford), which hosts some forks of projects
I've contributed to.
