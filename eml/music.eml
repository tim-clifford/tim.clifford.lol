<p>Today’s post is about something completely different from the usual
(if there even is a usual). I’ve decided to start recording and
publishing the music I’m working on!</p>
<p>I’m not trying to become an influencer or a professional musician or
anything, I just want my music-making to feel more purposeful than when
I’m playing to myself :]</p>
