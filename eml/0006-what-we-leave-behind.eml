<p>One day, we will all die. What can we hope for as consolation? Where
is our meaning in the face of our inevitable doom? Our lives are
fleeting, and, in a way, that makes them ever more beautiful. But our
finiteness is heart-wrenching too.</p>
<p>I hope that some piece of me, of my soul, can live on. Whether it’s
in a mediocre blog post, a dusty and almost forgotten book, or an
obscure scientific paper, I want some future person to read what I’ve
written and be hit by the realization that a real person was behind it.
A real, human, person poured their soul into those words, a person with
hopes and dreams and regrets and flaws, who experienced not just love
and happiness, but pain, and jealousy, and bitterness too.</p>
<p>That’s what this blog is really about, I suppose. What it’s always
been about. It’s me reaching out into the void, and saying: “I was here.
I existed.” I don’t want what I make to be perfect. I want it to be a
reflection of the real me. Not some polished version of me that never
really existed. Just me.</p>
<p>So, if you’re that future person, digging through the archives of
ancient times: Hi! What’s the world like? Have my fears come to life, or
was I being silly? You have no idea how much I want to just sit down
with you, grab some coffee, and chat.</p>
<p>Is coffee still around?</p>

I hope that some piece of me, of my soul, can live on. Whether it's in a mediocre blog post, a dusty and almost forgotten book, or an obscure scientific paper, I want some future person to read what I've written and be hit by the realization that a real person was behind it. A real, human, person poured their soul into those words, a person with hopes and dreams and regrets and flaws, who experienced not just love and happiness, but pain, and jealousy, and bitterness too.

That's what this blog is really about, I suppose. What it's always been about. It's me reaching out into the void, and saying: "I was here. I existed." I don't want what I make to be perfect. I want it to be a reflection of the real me. Not some polished version of me that never really existed. Just me.

So, if you're that future person, digging through the archives of ancient times: Hi! What's the world like? Have my fears come to life, or was I being silly? You have no idea how much I want to just sit down with you, grab some coffee, and chat.

Is coffee still around?
