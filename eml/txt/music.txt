Today's post is about something completely different from the usual (if there even is a usual). I've decided to start recording and publishing the music I'm working on!

I'm not trying to become an influencer or a professional musician or anything, I just want my music-making to feel more purposeful than when I'm playing to myself :]

If you're interested, check out my first upload:
