<p>Let me introduce you to a little game I like to call Entropy
Bingo.</p>
<p>Choose an action that you might take with expectations of anonymity,
and try to figure out whether a determined attacker can figure out who
you are, by counting up the bits of Shannon entropy they can determine.
If it reaches 33 bits (corresponding to the &gt;8 billion people on the
planet), you lose, and you have been deanonymised. If not, you win. For
simplicity, we assume each piece of information is uncorrelated with the
others. This isn’t really true, but it’s napkin maths anyway.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer 1: I should point out that I do not claim to be an
expert on anonymisation and deanonymisation, though it is a fascination
of mine. Make your own decisions, and consider my suggestions carefully.
Maybe one day I will be an expert, if that happens I’ll remove this
disclaimer :)</em></p>
<h2 id="example-1-convenience-store">Example 1: convenience store</h2>
<p>Here’s an example: I go to my local convenience store and buy an
item. I don’t take my phone or any other tracking device, and I pay in
cash. Am I anonymous?</p>
<p>Firstly, my adversary can narrow it down to the number of people who
might buy food at this particular store. Some very approximate maths
suggests that this already knocks off about 20 bits of entropy, but it
would be more if my store were very small. Fun.</p>
<p>I’m the type of person to pay in cash, which knocks off at least
another 3 bits, based on statistics about people’s payment preferences.
If my adversary has ever deanonymised me before, they will likely know I
pay in cash.</p>
<p>Most convenience stores have CCTV, so lets say my adversary can see
my face and what I’m buying. If I lived in China or New York<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> or any other place that uses facial
recognition without consent, I would already have lost. But let’s
continue anyway.</p>
<p>So, how many bits does my physical appearance count for? The gender I
present knocks off about 1 bit. I wear glasses, which knocks off about
another bit. My hair type knocks off about 3 bits. My approximate age
knocks off about 3 more bits.</p>
<p>That’s already 31/33 bits and I definitely haven’t thought of
everything. That’s seriously bad. Someone who reasonably might have all
that information can immediately narrow me down to one of 4 people.</p>
<p>Who would have all that information? Well, let’s say the convenience
store is storing all this video data in “the cloud”, which probably
means one of Google’s servers. And all of that information about my
characteristics and location? Google has that too. So, yes, even if I
don’t take a phone and even if I pay in cash, Google could deanonymise
me. Would they? I don’t know. But they certainly have incentive to.</p>
<h2 id="example-2-a-clandestine-deal">Example 2: a clandestine deal</h2>
<p>Ok, so you’re super paranoid and you think you’re smart. You go onto
the anonymous web (a Tor onion site), and find someone who lives in your
city of 100,000 people who has the thing you want. You make sure they
use Matrix, because you know it’s reasonably secure and private, and you
make a new Matrix handle to talk to them. You meet them in person in a
random place in the city to make the exchange, pay in cash, and wear
clothes you never usually wear - plus a cap and balaclava.</p>
<p><em>Busted!</em> You’ve still given away too much information.
What!!!??? Here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximate location: 16 bits</li>
<li>Use of Tor: at least 6 bits</li>
<li>Use of Matrix: 7 bits</li>
<li>Height: 2 bits</li>
<li>Approximate gender and age: 3 bits</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Total: 34 bits</strong></p>
<p>You made a few mistakes. The biggest was using Matrix.
<em>What??</em> you cry? But Matrix is secure! It’s private! It’s FOSS
and it has end-to-end encryption!!</p>
<p>Yes. But privacy is not anonymity. Security is not anonymity. For
anonymity, you need security and plausible deniability. For any given
action, there must be a large number of people who could be responsible
for it. You could have a perfectly private and secure system, but if
there are only two users, every action must have been made by one of
those two users. Tor and Matrix are only successful anonymising tools
when used extremely carefully.</p>
<p>Still, this example requires much more nuance. Who, specifically,
could deanonymise you? The person you’ve made a cash deal with might be
able to, but maybe not. The assumptions of this game are critical, and
hard to evaluate in the real world. Does your use of Tor actually reveal
6 bits? Your adversary won’t have a list of everyone who uses Tor, but
if you’re someone who cares this much about anonymity, you might have
publicly declared that Tor is a great tool and people should use it, in
which case there might be a list you’re on. The same goes for Matrix,
although an accurate list of users is probably a lot easier to come by.
Your adversary might not have an accurate list of people in your city
and their age/height/gender either, but a little digging on social media
would go a long way. (The possibility of your adversary being a law
enforcement agent would go a lot further, if your transaction were
illegal)</p>
<h2 id="what-should-you-do">What should you do?</h2>
<p>What would be a better strategy for a truly anonymous purchase? The
first thing to do is to randomise as many choices as you can. When
you’re looking for someone to transact with over Tor, find as many as
you can, and choose randomly, with probabilities proportional to the
number of customers you think they have. Don’t insist on a messaging
system, use whatever they use, provided that you can use it entirely
over Tor without giving up personal information (e.g., burner email
addresses or Facebook accounts are fine if you can do it without
identity verification). Make your search area as broad as possible,
perhaps even take a train into another city and do the transaction there
(try to avoid cameras as you do). Cover as many of your distinguishing
features as you can, but do it in a boring way - don’t wear a balaclava,
wear a mask, a beanie, and large sunglasses if it’s sunny.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should try to segment the information such that no
party has access to all of it. Don’t tell the person you transact with
about your journey, the rain you came through, when you got off work, or
anything else. In fact, it’s best if you don’t speak, your voice might
be distinctive.</p>
<p>Further, false information goes a long way. Put on a convincing wig.
Wear fake glasses if you have perfect eyesight. Put pebbles in your
shoes to change your gait. If you’re brave enough to speak, hint that
you came from a different city than you really did. Each bit of false
entropy can have serious anonymising power.<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="entropy-bingo-card">Entropy Bingo card</h2>
<p>To conclude, here’s a bingo card with some sources of information I
thought of that an attacker might use to remove your entropy. If you get
a bingo, they’ve probably got you. It’s highly approximate, though I’ve
been careful to keep incompatible or highly correlated sources of
information from being in the same row/column/diagonal, as much as
possible.</p>

<p>Ironically, many of the things on the bingo board, like Matrix, Tor,
and Linux, are things which protect your privacy. But because not enough
people use them, knowledge that you’re using them provides a fair bit of
deanonymisation power. The solution: get more people to use them, to
protect those that need anonymity.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer 2: I think I need to say that my fascination with
