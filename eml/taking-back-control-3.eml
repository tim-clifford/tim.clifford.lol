<p>From my manifesto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2.0) I will not depend on any proprietary software.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2.1) Proprietary software must be run in an [untrusted sandbox].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, continuing to use a proprietary Samsung device with a
proprietary software additions to Android (as well as some unremovable
proprietary apps) is unacceptable. I could have perhaps installed
LineageOS (a fully FOSS build of Android) on my old phone, but I figured
I’d go the whole mile and buy a PinePhone Pro, which is FOSS all the way
down to the PCB design (some of the chips e.g. the GSM module are
proprietary, sadly, though they are sandboxed). Naturally I’ve got it
running Arch Linux, for the memes but also because it works really well
lol.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-flumph">Introducing “flumph”</h2>
<p>Having silly naming schemes for things is fun, so I’ve decided to
call my new PinePhone Pro “flumph”, after the creature from Dungeons and
Dragons. Canonically, flumphs are very intelligent creatures, and are
immune to telepathy, just like how this flumph is (hopefully) resistant
to surveillance :D</p>
<p>(Fitting with the DnD creature theme, I’ve now named my outgoing
Samsung “Mind Flayer”, since it has been trying to enslave my
brain.)</p>
<h2 id="ricing-of-course">Ricing (of course)</h2>
<p>Naturally, on buying any new device, one must spend least 15 hours
“ricing” it (aka making it look good without improving usability). I
focused my ricing on the bootloader, since it’s the perfect place to put
flumph-themed artwork etc etc. Here are some pictures of the final
result:</p>

## Introducing "flumph"

Having silly naming schemes for things is fun, so I've decided to call my new PinePhone Pro "flumph", after the creature from Dungeons and Dragons. Canonically, flumphs are very intelligent creatures, and are immune to telepathy, just like how this flumph is (hopefully) resistant to surveillance :D

(Fitting with the DnD creature theme, I've now named my outgoing Samsung "Mind Flayer", since it has been trying to enslave my brain.)

## Ricing (of course)

Naturally, on buying any new device, one must spend least 15 hours "ricing" it (aka making it look good without improving usability). I focused my ricing on the bootloader, since it's the perfect place to put flumph-themed artwork etc etc. Here are some pictures of the final result:
