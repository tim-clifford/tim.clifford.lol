# Music

This is a place to share my music :] It's mostly for my own benefit, I just want my music-making to feel more purposeful than when I'm playing to myself!

The videos are all hosted on PeerTube, which is a fantastic alternative to YouTube that maintains freedom and privacy, and has no ads or anything like that :]
