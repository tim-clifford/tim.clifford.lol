Like many young people, I've been around technology my entire life. But until
very recently, I'd never really taken the time to take a step back and consider
its effects, both on my own life and on society at large.

What I'm coming to realise is that historically I've placed an enormous amount
of trust in very untrustworthy entities: the likes of Google, Microsoft,
Facebook, etc (and by proxy various governments). These entities have time and
time again proven their untrustworthiness, but like many others, I was swept
away by peer pressure and promises of increased convenience.

It's time to stop this. I'm taking back control. It'll be a long journey,
fraught with pissing a lot of people off, a whole barrel of FOMO, and clashing
with people in positions of "authority". But I refuse to put my life in the
hands of anyone so untrustworthy.

So I wrote a manifesto. It's basically a list of rules about what I will and
won't do, and will help me maintain privacy, ensure sovereignty over software I
depend on, reject mass data gathering, and make a statement about the
importance of FOSS.

[The manifesto can be found here](https://tim.clifford.lol/documents/technology-usage-manifesto.html)

I'm expecting to start following it around summertime (northern hemisphere),
and I'll definitely be making changes to the manifesto before then, so I'd
really appreciate any comments people have!
