2022-02-25T12:04:31+00:00	probably-not-unpopular opinion: rclone's man page is terrible. It's packed with uninteresting crap, most notably installation instructions. If I wanted installation instructions, I wouldn't already have the man page! Not to mention the fact that it recommends installing via `curl ... | bash`, which nobody should ever do.
